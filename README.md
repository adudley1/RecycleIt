**HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM**

1) Click "upload file" and choose an image of a household item you want to classify. It should say the file name next to the button when you import.
2) Press "go" and wait, this normally doesn't take long unless it's your first time using the program.
3) When it's done it should show the image you uploaded as well as what it identifies it to be, it's percent certainty, and if it's recyclable.
